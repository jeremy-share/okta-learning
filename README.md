# Okta Learning

Code and configurations I used to learn Okta.

**For example purposes only and not for production!** See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The code and configurations in this repo were put together quickly, with the main objective being to learn how Okta 
(an identity provider) interacts with service providers.
